# To-Do-List-App
About This Project :
I built this project while learning Java because I wanted to make something practical that I could actually use.
It’s a simple To-Do List app with a graphical interface, made using Java Swing. You can add tasks, mark them as done, delete them, and everything gets saved automatically,so your list is still there next time you open it.

This project helped me understand how GUIs work in Java and how to handle user actions (like button clicks) along with saving data in a file.

What It Can Do :
Add new tasks easily
Mark tasks as done (✔️) or pending (X)
Delete tasks you don’t need
Auto-save all tasks in a file
Tasks are numbered for better tracking
Green check marks for completed and red crosses for pending ones

What I Learned :
Creating a GUI using Java Swing
Handling user input and button events
Using File I/O to save and load data
Writing clean and simple Java code
Structuring a small project from start to finish

How To Run It :
Download or clone the repository
Open the folder in your IDE or Command Prompt
Compile the code using -
javac ToDoListGUI.java
Then run it using -
java ToDoListGUI

Folder Overview :
ToDoListApp/
  ToDoListGUI.java   → main app code
  tasks.txt          → stores your to-do items (auto created)
  README.md          → this file
